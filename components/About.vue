            <p>
                I am a penultimate computer science undergraduate at the National University of Singapore. I am passionate
                about building software that solves real-world problems and improves the lives of others.

                During my internship, I have worked around <span class="font-bold text-green">Fullstack Development</span>, handling both frontend and backend endpoint management.
                Most of my work revolve around <span class="font-bold text-yellow">Frontend Development</span> and <span
                    class="font-bold text-yellow">UI/UX Design</span>, which I polish consistently through projects and
                participating in hackathons.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also interested in <span class="font-bold text-blue-100">Machine Learning</span>, <span
                    class="font-bold text-blue-100">Natural Language Processing</span> and <span
                    class="font-bold text-blue-100">Computer Security</span>. I have taken modules in these areas and have
                worked on projects that involve them, such as building a search engine by prioritising query relevance.
